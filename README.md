## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm a junior developer currently diving deep into the world of back-end technologies. My learning journey is centered around Python and Flask, where I'm building foundational skills in creating APIs, handling databases, and structuring scalable backend applications.

As I continue to grow in this field, Iâ€™m also exploring how to deploy and manage applications using AWS. From setting up simple EC2 instances to experimenting with services like S3, Lambda, and RDS, Iâ€™m gaining hands-on experience with cloud infrastructure and learning how to bring projects from local development to live environments.

This repository is a collection of personal projects, practice exercises, and learning experiments. You'll find code related to Flask applications, RESTful API development, database integration using SQLAlchemy, and early experiments with deploying to AWS. I believe in learning by doing, so many of the projects here reflect real-world use cases I'm trying to understand and build from scratch.

My goal with this repository is not only to track my progress but also to share what Iâ€™m learning along the way. If youâ€™re also getting started with backend development or cloud services, I hope some of these projects and code snippets can be helpful to you.

Thanks for visiting! Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, or connect if you have feedback or advice. Iâ€™m excited about the journey ahead and always open to learning from the developer community. Every line of code is a step forward, and Iâ€™m looking forward to building more, learning more, and sharing more as I grow.
